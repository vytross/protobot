- Unfortunately, the game feature has been removed from ProtoBot. Don't worry, it will be added back sooner or later, whether it be to this bot or another. This change was made primarily for stability reasons, to ensure the bot shouldn't crash anymore under any circumstances.
- Further application-related bug fixes
### Pre-Release v0.1
#### Pre-Release v0.1.1
- Major application-related bug fixes, hopefully preventing further crashes related to incoming applications.

- Added new features for admins to have better control over applications.
- Fixed a few bugs that caused specific tic-tac-toe scenarios to crash the bot.
